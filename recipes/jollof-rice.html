    <h4>HOW TO PREPARE NIGERIAN JOLLOF RICE</h4>


    <ul>

      <li>First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell peppers, 
      (pimento), tomatoes, scotch bonnet, and onion.</li>
      <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions and 
      cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft.</li>
      <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic, ginger, 
      and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li> 
      <li>Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced 
      entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper—about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, white pepper, and seasoning cubes. 
      Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir the rice into the sauce until it is well coated. Then add the chicken stock, 
      stir, and cover with a tight-fitting lid, and then bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
      <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately 
      to low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>

    </ul>
