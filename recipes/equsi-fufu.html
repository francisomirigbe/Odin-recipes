    <h1>EGUSI AND FUFU</h1>

    <p>Egusi Soup is a rich and savory Nigerian soup made with ground melon seeds and eaten
       with fufu dishes. Fufu is a West African dish made from starchy root vegetables such 
       as cassava, yams, or plantains. It is typically boiled and pounded into a thick paste-like
       consistency before being served. Fufu is eaten with a variety of sauces and soups, 
       and is often considered to be a staple in many West African households</p>
