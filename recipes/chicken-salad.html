    <h4>HOW TO PREPARE CHICKEN SALAD</h4>

    <ul>

      <li>First, marinate the chicken: Place the chicken in a shallow dish and add the oil,
          lime juice plus zest, garlic, and seasonings. Rub the chicken well, then cover the
          dish and allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes over the counter.  
          If time allows, you can marinate in the fridge overnight.</li>
      <li>Make the dressing: Combine all dressing ingredients into a small bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>
      <li>Next, cook the chicken: Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken 
          and cook for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. 
          Allow the chicken to slightly cool, then slice it.</li> 
      <li>Assemble salad and serve: While the chicken cools, add all the salad ingredients to a bowl.
         Top with juicy chicken and drizzle the dressing over. Finally, toss to combine then serve. Enjoy!</li>
